                <h2>The First President Of India</h2>

                <p><b>Dr. Rajendra Prasad</b> born on 3 December, 1884, in Ziradei (in the Siwan district of Bihar), was
                    an Indian independence activist, lawyer, scholar and subsequently, the first President of India. He
                    was the son of Mahadev Sahai Srivastava, a Sanskrit scholar and Kamaleshwari Devi, a housewife. He
                    was a brilliant student and a topper in the exams throughout his academic years. Dr. Rajendra Prasad
                    was a lawyer but gave up his profession to join India’s freedom struggle. He empathised with the
                    condition of peasants exploited in the indigo planters in Bihar. He worked alongside Gandhiji to
                    uplift them. He was a well-regarded freedom fighter. He was also an active journalist and founded
                    and edited several publications. After India’s independence, Dr. Rajendra Prasad became the nation’s
                    first President and served in office for 12 years serving the country. For his service to the
                    nation, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna- India’s highest civilian honour.</p>
